        <h2>Description</h2>
    </p>
    <p>This is the easiest and fastest way I have found to cook a spaghetti squash. Cutting them in half was intimidating for me until I discovered the microwave trick, which makes cutting them in half a breeze.</p>

    <p class="ingredients">
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>

            <li>1 (3 pound) spaghetti squash</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon sea salt</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon smoked paprika</li>

        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Using a sharp knife, make a dotted line lengthwise around the entire squash. Place whole squash in the microwave and cook on full power for 5 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and cut the squash in half lengthwise, using the dotted line as a guide. Wrap one half in plastic wrap and refrigerate for another use.</li>
            <li>Spoon pulp and seeds out of remaining half and discard. Brush olive oil over all of the flesh and sprinkle with salt, pepper, and paprika.</li>
            <li>Preheat an air fryer to 360 degrees F (180 degrees C). Place spaghetti squash half skin side-down in the basket. Cook for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer to a dish and fluff with a fork to create 'noodles'.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
